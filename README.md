# RabbitMQ Output in Flexget

This is intended to be an output to rabbitMQ for flexget.
Since I want to use RabbitMQ more and more for my own applications, I felt that it was a good idea to also have Flexget talking over RabbitMQ.

## How to install

First of all, install the requirement(s).
* You need to have flexget installed (within the same virtualenv)
* You need to have pika installed (tested with version 0.10.0)

Place rabbitmq.py in your plugins folder, e.g. ~/.config/flexget/plugins/

Configure accordingly to the documentation.

## Configuration

You configure it according the provided table here.
All configuration is done in the main flexget config.

| Name | Description | Default | Required |
| ------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| host | The host that RabbitMQ is running on | localhost | no |
| port | RabbitMQ server port | 5672 | no |
| username | The username for RabbitMQ | guest | no |
| password | The password for RabbitMQ | guest | no |
| exchange | Which RabbitMQ exchange to use | '' | no |
| routing_key | The routing key to use for the message | | yes |
| delivery_mode | Which deliverymode that should be used | 2 | no |
| queue_name | The name of the queue to use for the message | | yes |
